# Reflection

*Be intentional about iterating for your next event.*

We often look at reflection as a kind of summative or closing exercise after a project, though it’s not. Reflection is the catalyst for improving your next event. While the debrief captures how you and your audience feel after a class, session, or workshop, reflections gives you the time and intentionality to analyze your data, performance, and needs for improvement.

This is the time to ask

- Did we build trust?
- Did we fulfill needs?
- Did we improve at small-loop decision making during our facilitation?

The answers to those questions should absolutely inform your design, planning, and delivery in the future. In this section we’ll look at ways to take advantage of reflection as learning and planning.
