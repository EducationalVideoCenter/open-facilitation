# 7. Failure

_Failure is feedback._

As facilitators, we experience all kinds of failure. Sometimes we shortcut things we shouldn’t shortcut. Sometimes we fail to anticipate something we simply couldn’t have known ahead of an event. Sometimes we find out, first-hand, that an activity we love - one of our darlings or gems -  just doesn’t cut it out in the real world.

We should expect to fail and we should expect ourselves to learn from failure.

In this section, we’ll consider different kinds of failure and what we can and cannot do about them as facilitators. We’ll also try to anticipate possible failures and prepare solutions for them ahead of time.

Failure is another form of feedback we can use to iterate and improve our work.
