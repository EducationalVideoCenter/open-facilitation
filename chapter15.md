# 5. Trust

_Build trust through excellent facilitation._

To teach and learn in community, you have to build trust. When you facilitate a class, session, or workshop, you serve as a kind of storyteller narrating the steps everyone takes to trust each other, to trust that your shared work has purpose, and to trust that everyone in the room can succeed.

In this section of the curriculum, we’ll review the steps we’ve taken so far to build trust with event organizers and attendees. Then we’ll set up additional steps we can take during and after an event to show our care for the learners we serve.
