# 10. Outcomes of open facilitation

_Look for incremental growth as you iterate your practice._

Part of improving your work as a facilitator is setting up processes for intentional change.

* To begin, adopt a design practice focused on your learners’ needs.
* As you go, look for opportunities to make small-loop, as well as big-loop, design decisions in the moment of teaching and learning.
* At the end of each event, capture reactions and feedback with a survey and debrief.
* Between events, reflect and iterate on your last event to plan for the next.
* Document everything and consider sharing your work openly to inspire others.

The more clarity you have about your design, the better able you’ll be to recruit and manage a team of colleagues and community members who can

* Revise and improve your plan.
* Work alongside you as co-facilitators in well-defined roles.
* Debrief and reflect in candid ways that help your improve your practice.

While working through this module, you’ve considered facilitation as both a design proves and a process meant to builds trust between

* You and your learners.
* Your learners and the content you’ve taught.
* You and your team.

This approach asks you to approach facilitation as a human-centered process, rather than an outcome-driven one. It asks you to write lesson plans for people, not for concepts or skills. It asks you to acknowledge and build from success and failure in equal measure.

It asks you to do better every instant you can.

That’s a big ask and a heavy lift, but this kind of facilitation is necessary to building community and developing leaders. When you invest in your learners instead of content, they know it. They’ll match your investment with a commitment to bring what they’ve learned to their own communities, lives, and workplaces. They’ll carry their learning forward in ways you can’t imagine - and that’s the point: to build a facilitation practice you can trust to empower others beyond yourself.
