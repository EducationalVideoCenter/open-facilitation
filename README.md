# Open Facilitation

## 0. Welcome & introduction

_**Let’s work together to become better facilitators.**_

Welcome to this guide to a personal, humane, and design-driven facilitation practice for activists, educators, and librarians. The lessons in this guide have been drawn from building networks and web literacy work at the [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/). This guide is licensed [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

This purpose of the guide is to help you think of facilitation as a design process and set of practices you can use to improve your teaching over time through close attention to learners' needs and your own assumptions about them.

* Each section of the curriculum will address a different topic. 
* Each subsection will unpack part of that topic 
* Each subsection will also suggest assignments that can help you develop your facilitation skills further.

If you’re curious about facilitating different kinds of work - such as event planning or project management - check out Mozilla’s [Open Leadership programs](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/), as well.
